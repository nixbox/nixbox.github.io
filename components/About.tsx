              I'm a software engineer with more than a decade of experience at Google, where I had the privilege of working on pioneering products. My career has been a journey through the stack, from contributing to the Wi-Fi systems of Google Glass to the Bluetooth experience on Pixel Buds. On the Android Bluetooth team, I helped start the challenging but rewarding transition from a legacy C++ codebase to the safety and performance of Rust.

              My professional work is fueled by a deep, personal curiosity. I've spent countless hours diving into the Linux kernel just to understand how networking stacks like TCP/IP are truly implemented. This desire to understand complex systems from first principles extends beyond technology.

              I'm fascinated by how the global economy works, the history of money, and the emergence of new paradigms like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. For me, learning isn't a passive activity. I learn by doingâ€”whether that means participating in financial markets or building software to solve a personal problem. These days, I'm actively experimenting with AI to accelerate both my learning and my ability to build.
